To achieve real-time communication between two computers over a direct Ethernet connection, you can use various methods:

## Method 1: Socket Programming
1. Create a server: Use a server-side script (e.g., Python's socket library) to listen for incoming connections.
2. Create a client: Use a client-side script to connect to the server and receive data.

## Method 2: TCP/IP Communication
1. Establish a connection: Use TCP/IP protocol to establish a connection between the two computers.
2. Send and receive data: Use sockets or libraries like twisted or scapy to send and receive data.

## Python Example
Here's a simple example using Python's socket library:

### Server-side code (processing computer)

import socket

# Create a socket object
server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Bind the socket to a specific IP and port
server_socket.bind(('192.168.1.1', 12345))

# Listen for incoming connections
server_socket.listen(1)

print("Server listening...")

while True:
    # Accept incoming connections
    client_socket, address = server_socket.accept()
    print("Connected to", address)

    # Send data to the client
    data = "Processing..."
    client_socket.sendall(data.encode())

    # Close the connection
    client_socket.close()


### Client-side code (display computer)

import socket

# Create a socket object
client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Connect to the server
client_socket.connect(('192.168.1.1', 12345))

# Receive data from the server
data = client_socket.recv(1024).decode()
print("Received:", data)

# Close the connection
client_socket.close()


## Real-time Display
To achieve real-time display, you can use techniques like:

- Streaming: Send data in small chunks, and display it on the client-side as it's received.
- WebSockets: Use WebSockets to establish a bi-directional communication channel between the server and client.

By using these methods, you can create a real-time display system where one computer processes data and sends it to another computer for display over a direct Ethernet connection [1].
